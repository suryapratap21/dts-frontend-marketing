      <h2>Pre Employment</h2>
      <p>
        A pre-employment drug test is a screening process employers use to
        ensure prospective employees are not using illegal drugs or certain
        substances that could impair job performance or violate workplace
        policies. These tests are typically conducted after a job offer has been
        made but before the individual starts work.
