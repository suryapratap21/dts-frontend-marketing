                  For the FMCSA Enrollment Plan:
                  <br />
                  <strong>
                    If I choose to rescind my $199.00 enrollment order before
                    specimens are collected at a patient service center, I will
                    receive a refund of $129.00 for the fees that were paid.
                    This refund is due to direct expenses associated with the
                    account setup process. In the event that I wish to cancel my
                    enrollment for $99.00, I will receive a refund of 39.00 of
                    the fees paid. This refund is due to direct expenses
                    associated with the account setup procedure. After the
                    specimen is collected at a donor service center, refunds
                    will not be issued as a result of the direct expenses
                    associated with specimen collection, supplies, employee
                    time, and courier services.

                </div>
                <p>
                  Section 2.01 pertains to the terms of the agreement. Unless
                  terminated by either party in accordance with Section 2.02,
                  the term of this Agreement (the "Term") will continue in
                  perpetuity.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Termination is addressed in Section 2.02. The parties have the
                  option to terminate this Agreement in the following manner:
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  (a) Termination for Customer Convenience. On written notice to
                  the Company, customers may terminate this Agreement
                  immediately for your convenience.
                  <br />
                  (b) Termination for Convenience (Company). Company may
                  terminate this Agreement and suspend all Services provided
                  hereunder upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice, which
                  may be provided via email.
                  <br />
                  (c) Termination for Cause. (i) If the other party breaches a
                  material term of this Agreement and fails to cure the same
                  within three (3) business days of receiving written notice
                  from the aggrieved party of the breach (unless such party is
                  afforded a shorter cure period under this Agreement), or (ii)
                  immediately if the other party ceases operation, dissolves, or
                  commences any bankruptcy, receivership, or other procedure for
                  the relief from creditors, either party may terminate this
                  Agreement for cause at any time. For the purposes of this
                  Section 2.2(c), customer's payment obligations of any kind
                  shall be considered a "material term," and the Company shall
                  be entitled to promptly terminate this Agreement in the event
                  of a breach.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The consequences of termination are detailed in Section 2.03.
                  The "Termination Date" shall be the final date of the Term of
                  this Agreement, which has been terminated in accordance with
                  this Article 2. Despite any provisions to the contrary in this
                  Agreement, the Company is obligated to provide the Customer
                  with any unremitted employee test results, evidence of
                  employee testing, annual or other regular testing that has not
                  yet been delivered. Alternatively, the Company shall promptly
                  transfer all such employee and related records in its
                  possession to a substitute C/TPA appointed by the Customer at
                  the parties' mutual election and at the expense of the
                  Customer (which shall refer to the Company's reasonable
                  administrative costs, to the extent permitted under Applicable
                  Law). The Company is obligated to maintain all records in its
                  possession that are required to be maintained under Applicable
                  Law for the duration specified in this Section 2.03, despite
                  the termination of this Agreement and the operation of this
                  Section 2.03. This includes, but is not limited to, annual
                  reports submitted to any Agency and other records related to
                  the testing process or training

                  ARTICLE III: FEES AND SERVICES
                </div>
                <p>
                  Company Services are detailed in Section 3.01. The following
                  services (the "Services") will be provided to the Customer by
                  the Company during the Term. The Customer may request each
                  service through the Company's online service portal (the
                  "Portal"), by telephone, or through any other channel in which
                  the Company accepts requests for Services.
                  <br />
                  (a) Testing conducted prior to employment. The Company will be
                  responsible for coordinating pre-employment testing for
                  prospective and newly-hired employees that the Customer has
                  identified through the Portal, in accordance with the
                  applicable law. For the purposes of this Section 3.01(a),
                  pre-employment testing shall encompass the testing of current
                  Customer employees who are transitioning to a Safety-sensitive
                  position or performing Safety-sensitive functions and have not
                  previously been subject to drug or alcohol testing under
                  Applicable Law (subject to Section 3.01(h)). Customers are
                  solely accountable for determining whether a prospective, new,
                  or transferred employee is required to undergo pre-employment
                  testing in accordance with Applicable Law. This includes
                  determining whether the functions to be performed or the
                  position to be filled by the employee are classified as
                  safety-sensitive.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  (b) Employee Testing at Random. Company shall coordinate
                  quarterly random drug and alcohol testing of the
                  Safety-sensitive employees of the Customer identified by the
                  Customer through the Portal, by telephone, or otherwise (the
                  "Employee Pool") in accordance with Applicable Law (i.e.,
                  January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, October 1st). The company
                  will employ randomizing software that has been deemed
                  compliant by the DOT or other relevant state or federal
                  agencies. To the best of the company's ability, a strictly
                  random drawing will be conducted from the Employee Pool (or
                  from a broader consortium of third-party test candidates, as
                  applicable). This pool shall include all personnel subject to
                  testing, including, but not limited to, temporary and seasonal
                  employees.. In the event that the Customer is regulated by
                  more than one agency, the Company may assign all Employees to
                  the same Customer Pool or Consortium Pool at its discretion.
                  The Company will notify the Customer of the random employee
                  selection via text message at the Customer's request. These
                  messages will have the same effect as those delivered through
                  the Portal, by mail, or in any other manner. The customer is
                  accountable for all fees and expenses that are associated with
                  the receipt of text messages. Customers have the option to
                  decline text-based notifications at any time by informing the
                  Company of their intention in the manner outlined in Section
                  8.03. The company will determine the employees who have been
                  chosen for random drug or alcohol testing on a Customer Pool
                  or Consortium Pool basis in the following manner:
                  <br />
                  (i) Customer Base. In the event that the Customer has a list
                  of qualifying Safety-sensitive employees and contractors that
                  consists of ten (10) or more individuals, the Company shall
                  establish a random pool of such individuals to the exclusion
                  of all third parties (a "Customer Pool") upon mutual agreement
                  by the parties. At the rates of selection outlined in Sections
                  4.01 and 4.02, the Company will exclusively conduct random
                  employee selections from this Customer Pool.
                  <br />
                  (ii) Consortium Pool. The Company may consolidate
                  safety-sensitive employees from one or more employers or
                  DOT-regulated industries (e.g., commercial transportation and
                  aviation) into a single random pool (each, a "Consortium
                  Pool") in accordance with 49 CFR 40.347 and other Applicable
                  Law. If the Customer has fewer than ten (10) qualifying
                  employees or contractors in its Employee Pool, the Company
                  will automatically designate them to a Consortium Pool for
                  random selection.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  (c) Testing for Reasonable Suspicion. The Company shall
                  coordinate the testing of Employees when prompted by the
                  Company's suspicion of drug and/or alcohol abuse or
                  consumption, as provided under Applicable Law. The
                  determination of suspicion by the Customer must be
                  substantiated by a supervisor's observations in accordance
                  with DOT guidance, including; but not limited to, then-current
                  U.S. Guidance for Drug and Alcohol Supervisor Training at the
                  Department of Transportation. The Company is not liable for
                  the failure of the Customer to promptly initiate Employee
                  testing in response to reasonable suspicion of alcohol or drug
                  use, as required by Applicable Law, for the misapplication of
                  metrics and parameters to suspicious activities, or for any
                  other Customer error or oversight relating to its Employees
                  under this Section.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  (d) Post-accident testing. The post-accident testing of
                  Customer's employees shall be coordinated by the Company in
                  accordance with the applicable law, as requested by the
                  Customer from time to time. The Company is not obligated to
                  initiate any post-accident testing unless requested by the
                  Customer, nor is it obligated to independently verify the
                  reasonableness of the Customer's suspicions.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  (f) Follow-up Testing and Return to Duty. The Company is
                  responsible for coordinating the "return to duty" and
                  "follow-up" testing of Customer's Employees in accordance with
                  the applicable law, as requested by the Customer from time to
                  time.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  (f) The nature of coordination and the utilization of the
                  portal. For the purposes of Section 3.01, all references to
                  "coordination" of drug and alcohol testing shall refer to the
                  following: the facilitation of employee scheduling for drug
                  and alcohol testing, the maintenance of an accurate geographic
                  list of qualifying testing labs, and similar services. These
                  services will be provided through the Portal, or by telephone
                  or other means of correspondence at the Company's sole
                  discretion.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  (g) Employees who have been transferred. The Company will
                  include the new employees of the Customer in the Portal and
                  the Employee Pool. This includes employees who have been
                  transferred from another employer that is regulated by the
                  Agencies and have undergone drug and/or alcohol testing within
                  the thirty (30) day period prior to their arrival. Onboarding
                  to the Portal shall be conducted in accordance with the
                  procedures outlined in Section 3.01(a) for all other
                  employees.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  (h) Certificates of Enrollment; Signup and Onboarding; Related
                  Documents. Company shall enroll Customer into its Portal
                  within a commercially reasonable period of time (but in any
                  event, within two (2) calendar weeks) upon Customer's
                  execution of this Agreement and the satisfaction of any
                  conditions precedent (including the payment of any advanced
                  Service Fees). During this onboarding process, the Company
                  will furnish the Customer with a certificate of enrollment, an
                  employee education guide, and any other documents that the
                  Company is obligated to provide to the Customer under
                  Applicable Law, such as a C/TPA, provided that all applicable
                  prior conditions have been met by the Customer.
                  <br />
                  (i) Observance of any applicable laws. The company shall have
                  the freedom to perform any other services that are
                  contemplated by or required by the applicable law. Such
                  Services shall not be interpreted as a breach of this
                  Agreement or as a commitment to perform such Services for
                  Customer on an ongoing basis (during or after the Term),
                  except where required by Applicable Law. Service Exclusions,
                  Section 3.02. The following services are not the
                  responsibility of the Company under this Agreement: (a)
                  Compliance with customer requirements. The Company is not
                  liable for the provision of drug or alcohol supervision or
                  testing policies to the Customer, or for the enforcement of
                  any of the Customer's policies, practices, or procedures,
                  including, but not limited to: (i) ensuring that the
                  educational materials, policies, and procedures provided by
                  the Customer to its employees meet the minimum requirements
                  set forth by Applicable Law, or ensuring that the employee
                  signs statements acknowledging receipt of the materials. (ii)
                  guaranteeing that administrators are trained in accordance
                  with the applicable law (e.g., 49 C.F.R. §382.603); (iii)
                  verifying that the Customer is exempt from supervisory
                  obligations as an owner-operator; (iv) adhering to the
                  requirements to discontinue the administration of
                  post-accident testing after the time periods specified under
                  Applicable Law (e.g., within 8 hours for alcohol testing and
                  32 hours for drug testing under FMCSA regulations); and (iv)
                  any other statutes that may be applicable to the Customer or
                  its employees.
                  <br />
                  (b) Scheduling of Tests. Company shall maintain records of
                  Customer's training regimen and schedule in accordance with
                  Article V. However, Company shall not be held accountable for
                  verifying that Customer's employees have scheduled or
                  completed their tests in a manner that satisfies or is likely
                  to satisfy Customer's quarterly, annual, or other testing
                  obligations, as applicable. The company is not liable for
                  reminding the employees of the customer to schedule testing
                  appointments or take any other compliance measures.
                  <br />
                  (c) Intermediary services are prohibited. The Company will not
                  act as an intermediary in the transmission of drug test
                  results from the laboratory to the MRO, will not accept test
                  results directly from a laboratory, and will not transmit drug
                  test results directly to the Customer from the laboratory.
                  Section 3.03 pertains to service fees. In accordance with the
                  Company's then-current fee schedule, which is incorporated
                  herein by reference, the Company will charge the Customer fees
                  for the Services requested by the Customer from time to time
                  (the "Service Fee(s)"). The Company is authorized to modify
                  its Service Fees at any time by providing written notice of
                  thirty (30) days (which may be via email) and unilaterally
                  updating its fee schedules without requiring the Customer's
                  assent to amend this entire Agreement. The Company's sole
                  remedy in the event of any modification to the Service Fees is
                  to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Article II.
                  Suspension of Services; Billing and Invoicing; Section 3.04.
                  The Company reserves the right to invoice the Customer for the
                  Service Fees in advance or in arrears, with or without
                  automatic invoicing, as outlined in this Section 3.04. The
                  Company shall have the exclusive right to determine the
                  estimated Service Fees for invoices to be paid in advance of
                  the Services using any methodology it deems appropriate,
                  including, but not limited to, the number of Employees in the
                  Company's Portal account and the categories of Services
                  requested. All Services Fees are due and payable in full
                  within thirty (30) calendar days when the Customer is invoiced
                  in arrears. Any sum that remains unpaid when it is due under
                  this Section 3.04 will accrue interest at a rate of one and
                  one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or the utmost rate of
                  interest permitted under the usury laws that apply to
                  Customer, whichever is lower. Company shall be permitted to
                  promptly suspend its Services in response to any delinquent
                  payment of the Service Fees and, in its sole discretion,
                  terminate this Agreement under Section 2.02(b) except where
                  prohibited by Applicable Law
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Company will invoice the Customer using one or more of the
                  following methods: Prepayment: The customer is required to
                  submit payment in advance for all Services that the company is
                  to provide under this agreement. Before the Company commences
                  any Services, including enrollment as described in Section
                  3.01(i), the Customer is required to submit an initial advance
                  deposit in a sum that the Company may establish from time to
                  time at its sole discretion. This deposit will be debited from
                  the Customer's account. The Company is not obligated to
                  perform any Services or complete Services that have been
                  initiated but not yet paid for in full, unless the Customer
                  makes full payment in advance. The company may request
                  supplemental deposits in the event that deposit funds are
                  depleted, new services or employees are added to the
                  customer's account, or for any other reason. Net 30 Payment:
                  The Company will invoice the Customer for the Services on a
                  monthly basis, with all payments due in full within thirty
                  (30) calendar days. Credit Card Auto-Pay: The Company will
                  invoice the Customer for the Services on a monthly basis, or
                  as the Services are rendered, at the Company's sole
                  discretion. All payments will be charged against the
                  Customer's credit card that is on file with the Company. The
                  customer is solely responsible for ensuring that the credit
                  card designated for automatic payments under this invoicing
                  method is current. Company reserves the right to suspend its
                  Services, bill Customer in arrears, demand immediate payment
                  by alternative means, or take any other lawful actions it
                  deems appropriate under the circumstances to resolve any
                  outstanding invoice in the event that Company is unable to
                  charge Customer's card on file and Customer fails to provide
                  Company with a replacement card within a five (5) business day
                  period.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Section 3.05: Payment Method. The customer is responsible for
                  paying any invoice by credit card, ACH transaction, wire
                  transfer, or any other method that the parties agree upon when
                  it is due. The Company is authorized to recover reasonable
                  credit card processing fees from the Customer in addition to
                  the Service Fees, as applicable.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Section 3.06 pertains to the utilization of the Portal.
                  Company shall implement commercially reasonable safeguards to
                  safeguard information transmitted through the Portal; however,
                  it cannot ensure that its security protocols are impenetrable.
                  The company cannot guarantee that third parties will not
                  intercept, alter, compromise, or exploit customer information.
                  The customer is accountable for safeguarding the
                  confidentiality of any Portal username and password that have
                  been assigned to them. The Company is not liable for the
                  authorized use of the Portal that is the result of the
                  Customer's failure to adequately secure its access
                  information.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Invoice Text Message Notifications (Section 3.07). Instead of
                  receiving mailed invoices, the customer has the option to
                  receive invoice payment notifications and reminders via text
                  message at a number that the customer specifies. When the
                  Company sends text messages in accordance with this Section,
                  they are considered to have been received. The customer is
                  accountable for all fees and expenses that are associated with
                  the receipt of text messages. The customer has the option to
                  discontinue receiving text-based notifications at any time by
                  informing the company of their intention in the manner
                  outlined in Section 8.03

                  be in accordance with the Agency rules applicable to the
                  Employees, as specified below: (a) fifty percent (50%) for
                  Employees regulated under the FMCSA; (b) twenty-five percent
                  (25%) for Employees regulated under the FAA; and (c) in

                  <br />
                  Section 4.03 specifies the standards for randomization. The
                  Company shall establish a pool of employees that are subject
                  to randomization, utilizing the list of employees that the
                  Company has made available to it through the Portal (or as
                  otherwise provided to the Company). The Company is not
                  obligated to independently verify the accuracy of any employee
                  list and is permitted to rely on the active list of employees
                  on the Portal. The minimum standards for scientific validity
                  established by the DOT from time to time (e.g., random-number
                  tables, computer-based random number generators traceable to
                  specific employees) must be met by the tools used by the
                  Company to randomize its sampling of Customer Employees.
                  Examples of such tools include software, algorithms, and other
                  methodologies. The customer shall not be entitled to inspect
                  these randomization tools (including the software they are
                  constituted of), demand their modification, or request an
                  independent evaluation of the accuracy of the Company's
                  randomization tools. The more stringent of the several
                  applicable Agency standards shall be applied to the Customer's
                  Employee Pool when Employees are placed in an Employee Pool or
                  Consortium Pool that includes employees regulated by multiple
                  Agencies. The customer specifically acknowledges that all
                  employees are replaced into the random pool after each
                  selection period. Consequently, any given employee may be
                  selected for testing multiple times, even if they have
                  recently tested.

                  Section 4.04 Approved and Alternate Collection Sites and
                  Testing Laboratories. Through the Portal, the Company will
                  direct the employees of the Customer to one of several urine
                  and/or breath collection sites that have been approved by the
                  relevant agency to collect or receive urine and breath
                  samples. These collection sites will either conduct screenings
                  or send the samples to a third-party laboratory for testing
                  and screening. The customer acknowledges that the company
                  shall not be obligated to independently verify the credentials
                  of its third-party sites or laboratories, beyond confirming
                  the DOT's certification of the site or laboratory to conduct
                  the sample collection and/or testing. The Customer shall have
                  the discretion to direct their Employees to a qualified
                  collection site or laboratory of their choosing outside the
                  Portal. However, the Customer shall be solely responsible for
                  all costs and expenses incurred by such election, including
                  processing and administrative fees levied by the Company. The
                  Company is not obligated to provide any coordination-related
                  Services with respect to samples that are directed to sites or
                  laboratories outside the Portal, including follow-up
                  procedures. The Customer agrees to assume all responsibility
                  for these matters, unless the Parties otherwise agree in a
                  separate writing, which may be by email. If Customer chooses
                  to utilize an alternative approved laboratory, it must be one
                  of the following, or the Company will not be obligated to
                  provide any services to the Customer with respect to that
                  Employee:

                  Testing Procedures are detailed in Section 4.04. Third-party
                  sample collection sites and laboratories are required to
                  establish their own procedures and practices regarding, among
                  other things, the criteria for establishing diluted samples,
                  invalid specimens, substituted samples, acceptable levels of
                  adulterants, storage and retention of specimens, and
                  recordkeeping obligations. The Company is not accountable for
                  the compliance of any third-party site or laboratory with
                  Applicable Law. Any actions, claims, damages, or grievances
                  that Customers may have against such third parties should be
                  directed purely at the third party in question.

                  <br />
                  Tests that have been canceled are detailed in Section 4.05.
                  The customer is solely responsible for instructing its
                  employees to promptly provide an alternative testing specimen
                  in the event that a test result is canceled and a negative
                  result is required. Although the Company will not charge the
                  Customer for testing errors caused by the actions of
                  third-party collectors, labs, or other similar parties, the
                  Customer shall be responsible for any costs and charges that
                  result from the actions of the Customer's Employees. This
                  includes, but is not limited to, specimen adulteration or any
                  other factors that result in an inconclusive or canceled test.
                  The Company will issue a bill to the Customer for these costs.
                  Company shall have the right to determine, in its sole
                  reasonable discretion, whether Employee error or conduct is
                  the proximate cause of any such canceled or inconclusive test
                  result.

                  Confidentiality is addressed in Section 6.01. The Company will
                  take reasonable measures to ensure the confidentiality of
                  information pertaining to the identity and employment status
                  of Employees, as well as any other similar nonpublic
                  information (collectively, "Employee Information"), that is
                  generated pursuant to this Agreement. Employee Information
                  will not be disclosed to any third party (including any
                  representative of Customer who is not expressly authorized by
                  Customer to receive such information) without the prior
                  approval of the Customer. Notwithstanding the aforementioned,
                  the Company shall promptly comply with all third-party
                  requests for disclosure of Employee Information that are
                  mandated by Applicable Law. In accordance with applicable

                  and other third parties who are subject to confidentiality
                  obligations that are no less stringent than those outlined in
                  this document. In accordance with 49 C.F.R. §40.351, the
                  Company is prohibited from disclosing individual test results
                  or other confidential Employee Information to another employer
                  without the Employee's specific, written consent. The Company
                  will not utilize blanket consent forms that authorize the
                  release of Employee testing information. Additionally, the
                  Company will implement and enforce sufficient confidentiality
                  and security measures to prevent unauthorized access to
                  Employee Information. These measures may include the physical
                  security of records, the implementation of adequate access
                  controls, and the implementation of computer security measures
                  to protect data in Company databases. The Portal's terms and
                  conditions, which are incorporated herein by reference, shall

                  respect to the Portal, as they may be amended from time to
                  time.

                  Law, as stipulated in Section 7.02. The Customer's list of
                  Employees shall be updated at least once per month, with the

                  directly or indirectly in connection with or related to the
                  Customer's performance under this Agreement, and that are
                  caused in whole or in part by the negligence, recklessness, or
                  intentional conduct of the Customer (or Customer's employees,
                  contractors, agents, or other representatives).
                  <br /> <br />
                  Company shall provide Customer with prompt written notice of
                  any facts upon which the Company intends to base a request for
                  indemnification, including, but not limited to, a description
                  of any third-party claim and the nature and amount of any
                  damage, costs, or losses (to the extent known or suspected at
                  the time of notice), as a condition precedent to Customer's
                  obligations under this Section. The Company shall promptly
                  provide the Customer with copies of all documents received in
                  connection with any third-party claim. The customer's
                  obligation to defend shall commence immediately upon the
                  receipt of notice of any applicable claim. Customer may, at
                  its discretion, assume responsibility for the defense of all
                  applicable claims by sending written notice of the assumption
                  to Company within ten (10) business days of receiving notice
                  of any indemnifiable claim. This notice must acknowledge
                  responsibility for the defense of all applicable claims. The
                  Company shall provide Customer with full cooperation in
                  connection with any such defense and may at any time retain
                  separate counsel to represent it, provided that the Company is
                  solely responsible for the costs and expenses of such separate
                  counsel. Company may, notwithstanding the aforementioned,
                  choose to defend any claim against it with counsel of its own
                  choosing, without Customer's participation, if Customer fails
                  or refuses to properly undertake the defense. Customer shall
                  promptly and periodically reimburse Company for all reasonable
                  legal expenses if Company manages its own defense.
                  Additionally, Customer shall remain accountable to Company for
                  any losses resulting from third-party claims. The Company
                  shall not resolve or compromise any third-party claim without
                  the prior written consent of the Customer, which consent shall
                  not be unreasonably withheld

                  performance hereunder will not and will not conflict with or
                  result in any breach or default under any other agreement to

                <p>
                  Section 8.01 governs the law. This Agreement shall be governed
                  by the internal laws of the State of California in all
                  respects, without regard to principles of choice of law.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Section 8.02 pertains to force majeure. Neither Party shall be
                  held accountable for any delay or failure to fulfill any
                  non-monetary obligation under this Agreement to the extent
                  that such delay is caused by acts of God, wars, revolution,
                  civil commotion, acts of public enemy, embargo, acts of
                  government in its sovereign capacity, catastrophic weather
                  events (including without limitation typhoons or earthquakes),
                  or any other circumstances beyond the reasonable control of
                  the Delayed Party, as defined below (individually, a
                  "Condition"). In the event of any Condition, the Party that is
                  delayed or unable to perform (the "Delayed Party") shall be
                  excused from such performance on a day-to-day basis during the
                  continuance of the Condition, and the other Party shall
                  likewise be excused from performance of its obligations on a
                  day-to-day basis during the same period. However, the Delayed
                  Party so affected shall make every reasonable effort to avoid
                  or remove the Condition, and both Parties shall immediately
                  resume the performance of their obligations under this
                  Agreement upon the removal or cessation of the Condition.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Section 8.03 pertains to notifications. Any notice, request,
                  demand, or other communication required or permitted by this
                  Agreement must be in writing, reference this Agreement, and be
                  delivered by hand, sent via email to the email address
                  provided below, received by registered or certified mail with
                  return receipt requested and postage prepaid, or received by
                  an express courier with written confirmation of receipt. The
                  customer has the option to withdraw their assent to receive
                  text messages by either responding with "STOP" through the
                  text messaging service provided by the company or by
                  contacting the company in the manner outlined in this section.
                  All notices shall be delivered or sent to the address
                  specified below (or to any other address or individual that a
                  Party may designate by providing written notice to the other
                  Party in accordance with this Section).

                  Severability is addressed in Section 8.04. The remainder of
                  the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
                  not be affected, impaired, or invalidated in the event that a
                  court of competent jurisdiction determines any term,
                  provision, covenant, or condition of this Agreement to be
                  invalid, void, or unenforceable.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Section 8.05 Amendment; Waiver; Remedies. This Agreement may
                  not be amended or waived except by a written instrument signed
                  by duly authorized representatives of the Parties, unless
                  otherwise specified in this Agreement. The Company may
                  unilaterally amend any exhibit to this Agreement through a
                  separate writing, notwithstanding the aforementioned, without
                  securing an amendment of this entire Agreement. The amended
                  exhibits may be attached to this Agreement with the same
                  operative force as the original exhibit. On ten (10) calendar
                  days' notice to the Customer, the Company may modify its
                  Services, including the elimination of any aspect of its
                  Services, without breaching this Agreement. The failure to
                  exercise any right under this Agreement shall not be construed
                  as a waiver of that right. Any waiver of any breach of this
                  Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent
                  breaches. All rights and remedies that are specified for a
                  party in this document shall be cumulative and in addition to
                  all other rights and remedies that the party has under this
                  agreement or applicable law.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Attorneys' fees are addressed in Section 8.06. In the event
                  that any legal action, arbitration, or other proceeding is
                  initiated to enforce this Agreement or due to an alleged
                  dispute, breach, default, or misrepresentation connected with
                  any of the provisions of this Agreement, the successful or
                  prevailing party or parties shall be entitled to recover
                  reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs incurred in that
                  action or proceeding, in addition to any other relief to which
                  they may be entitled.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Counterparts are addressed in Section 8.07. This Agreement may
                  be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be considered
                  an original; however, when combined, they shall comprise a
                  single and identical instrument.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Section 8.08 pertains to dispute resolution. In the event of
                  any dispute regarding this Agreement, the Parties shall
                  endeavor to resolve all disputes, claims, or controversies
                  that arise out of or relate to this Agreement through
                  mediation, administered by a mediator who has been mutually
                  approved by the Parties. The Parties will equally distribute
                  any costs and fees during the mediation process, with the
                  exception of the attorneys' fees of each party. The Parties
                  shall submit the matter to binding arbitration in Los Angeles
                  County, California, in the event that mediation fails to fully
                  resolve any residual claim, dispute, or controversy, or if the
                  parties are unable to mutually select a mediator in good
                  faith. In good faith, the Parties shall mutually agree upon an
                  arbitration company to administer the arbitration. Any court
                  with jurisdiction over the controversy's subject matter may
                  render a judgment on the award. The Parties are required to
                  maintain the confidentiality of the arbitration award, which
                  includes the nature and content of the proceedings that led to
                  the award.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The entire agreement is outlined in Section 8.09. This
                  Agreement (including its exhibits) is intended to be a
                  complete and final expression of the terms of the agreement
                  between the parties, and it supersedes all prior agreements,
                  understandings, and communications between the Parties,
                  whether written or oral, express or implied, relating to the
                  subject matter of this Agreement. The Parties hereby terminate
                  any prior agreement(s) regarding the provision of Services. In
                  the event that this Agreement and its exhibits are in conflict
                  with any other agreements between the parties, this Agreement
                  shall prevail. The recitals shall be interpreted as material
                  provisions of this Agreement.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Additional assurances are provided in Section 8.10. In order
                  to execute and deliver the purposes and intent of this
                  Agreement, each party shall execute and deliver any
                  instruments that may be reasonably necessary to the other
                  party (or to any applicable third-party). This Section shall
                  not be interpreted as imposing any obligation on the Company
                  to complete, submit, or file reports or other documents or
                  instruments with any third party, including any Agency, except
                  in cases where such obligation is included in the Services or
                  is mandated by Applicable Law.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Section 8.11: Liability Limitation. EXCEPT FOR CUSTOMER'S
                  INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 7.02, EACH PARTY'S
                  LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO ACTUAL DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL
                  EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR SPECIAL,
                  INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN
                  CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY
                  THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
                  THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY
                  FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY OF ANY
                  KIND.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  No assignment is specified in Section 8.12. In order to assign
                  its rights or delegate its obligations under this Agreement,
                  neither Party may do so without the prior written consent of
                  the other Party. This consent may not be unreasonably withheld
                  or delayed. In spite of the aforementioned, the Company may
                  transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement to a
                  parent or subsidiary, a successor, or through a merger, sale
                  of all or substantially all of its assets or business, or any
                  other means. Any endeavor to assign this Agreement that does
                  not comply with this subsection shall be deemed null and void.
                  The Parties and their respective successors and permitted
                  assigns will benefit from and be bound by all of the terms and
                  provisions of this Agreement.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Survival is the subject of Section 8.13. Sections 2.03
                  (Effects of Termination), 3.04 (Billing & Invoicing;
                  Suspension of Services), 6.01 (Confidentiality), and 7.02
                  (Indemnification and Procedures), as well as all other
                  provisions that, by their nature and in accordance with the
                  Parties' intention, should continue to be enforceable beyond
                  the Termination Date, shall survive the termination of this
                  Agreement
                </p>
                <br />
